The self-determined handling and protection of our data as well as our privacy is perceived by our society as a prerequisite; however, in the digital world that surrounds us all, matters are pointing in the opposite direction. We lose the often believed guarantee of these characteristics by mostly using tools for free. In our social interaction, it is good manners to always use the latest and trendiest apps, but an important routine, specifically to question what exactly is happening with our data in the background, is becoming increasingly blunted."
