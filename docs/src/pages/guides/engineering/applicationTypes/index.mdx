# Guidelines for new applications types

> More simply than ever, the human being binds himself particularly to digital
> services, which are preferentially used in the social fabric.

## Bonding effects

A high satisfaction of the user, a steady and almost complete availability of
contacts, which collectively define the social fabric of a user, lead to
significant binding effects.

> Several factors observed in everyday life (habit and regular routine) **make
> it difficult to convince the average user** to switch from an existing digital
> platform to a completely new and potentially more trustworthy digital
> platform. Today's heavy-weights in the market for social media applications
> connect significantly more than two billion people with each other and depict
> the social fabric already very closely in a digital form.

The human being is influenced by the following aspects in his ability to act and
make decisions, which are the main services of his choice.

1. Number and nature of contacts available as participants in a digital social
   network.

2. Extent of the shared content or the feedback received for it.

3. Quality, functionality and mobile availability of the platform in use.

The user will always seek the platform with the **highest added value** in terms
of interconnectivity with other people, **regardless of the impact on the
individual**.

## What is feasible and what is not

1. The Code of Conduct of companies which consider the information contained in
   personal data to be currency cannot be changed even by legislative
   regulations regarding privacy.

2. Most users rarely think about their online activities.

> **The user's habit can hardly be influenced.**

## Notice

A technique that promises a solution to the problem must take these factors into
account from the very beginning. The user's acceptance determines the audience
reach of an application.

> The approach followed in Project Millipede allows the user **from the very
> beginning** to use the favoured digital platform in the same way as before.
