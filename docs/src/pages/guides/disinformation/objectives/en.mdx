# Objectives and intentions of various actors

> Actors who seed critical content, pursue different objectives and intentions.

1. **Regime-oriented countries** - Apply censorship through soft methods of
   repression to influence or control the political sentiment within the
   population. If individuals get the possibility of opposition to organise
   themselves with other actors, this can lead to a potential threat to existing
   power structures - see Chapter 18.3 - Initial situation in autocratic
   systems.

2. **Terrorist groups** - Creation of fear and insecurity among people to
   destabilise democratic and developed social structures. The impact of
   extremism is not limited to the region in which a conflict takes place, but
   transcends every country border. A major goal of these actors is to recruit
   new followers and soldiers to wage war against humanity.

3. **Populism** - For several years now, populism has also been observed in
   pro-democratic societies with a well developed system of democratic values
   and morals. A growing proportion of the population takes part in anonymised
   or covert hate speech and the spread or dispersion of false information.

People involved in these different actions or movements often share a common
cultural, political or social sentiment or dissatisfaction.

The majority of the average user often does not recognise the far-reaching
effect of the methods used in social media, which are caused by an interaction
(rating or comment) with existing content. The user fails to acknowledge that a
simple interaction with racist or xenophobic content contaminates his own social
structure as depicted in the digital world in such a way that existing
friendships or relationships are cancelled. This leads to an entry into social
isolation. Populist groups abuse this situation in order to use the values and
opinions of those affected to promote their own ideology - see Chapter 18.2 -
Initial situation in democratic entities.

The present paper does not discuss the motivation or objectives of the actors in
detail. A reader who is particularly interested in this argumentation is
referred to the concluding chapter of the present paper. The table included in
this chapter contains references to several external publications that have been
prepared in addition to this paper.

## Common agenda of the actors

The common agenda of these actors is to maximise the reach of their own
campaigns that convey critical content. In order to achieve the largest
distribution radius in the social fabric, actors apply several strategies or
rather distribution waves.

### Initial publication / channeled distribution

The actor (author) who is primarily responsible for the creation and
distribution of the content. Does the author have an **extensive community**
that subscribes to the content or news channel, the following intermediate step
is not mandatory - a repeated publication increases the degree of distribution
without the author's intervention. If the accessible community comprises only a
**very small number of participants**, the author follows the channelled
distribution to position the content into the visible field of a larger
community. The author tries to propose the content in established news channels
in which the community corresponds to the identical or similar thematic area
assigned to the content. The author of the content reaches a so-called 1st level
follower due to matching interests.

### Repeated publication

The actor involved in a community shows interest in the content and carries out
a rating (interaction) of the content. Based on the subsequent description, each
participant involved in the community who performs an interaction with the
content acts as a multiplier.

1. Each participant in a group, who has a joint interest in the author's
   content, is directly linked to the author (1st level follower).
2. Each participant in this group maintains a considerable network of contacts
   or social structure, which includes a wide variety of actors such as family,
   friends and colleagues.

   On average, each user has 342 contacts in the most popular social network
   "Facebook".

   From the author's perspective, any contact that is not directly related to
   the author is called an n-level follower. Contacts within the social
   structure of the 1st level follower are therefore called 2nd level followers
   from the author's perspective. The content published by the author and the
   field of vision of the 2nd level follower are only one interaction step
   apart.

3. Several actors who perceive the author's content via a subscription (1st
   level followers) interact inadvertently or consciously with the content
   published by the author.

   If a member of the 1st level follower group interacts with the author's
   (critical) content, the platform operator relays a signal to the contacts
   involved within the social structure (2nd level follower).

4. This signalling objective is to attract the attention of the participants
   involved in the social structure by pointing out activities or reactions to
   content or persons that may coincide with their individual interests.

### Indirect Re-Distribution

The actor tries to establish a positive reputation from a large user base by
initially distributing only content with high integrity and truthfulness. The
actor progressively creates several user profiles. The actor gradually changes
his behavior, which kind of content is published via his user profiles.
Initially, uncritical content is published, but this content is increasingly
mixed with critical content.

Semi- or fully automated procedures are used to establish isolated or
independent distribution vectors that the average user follows erroneously. The
actor uses this sort of technology, such as social bots, to link the user
profiles, which are controlled by the actor, with the aim of establishing a
covert transit for the distribution of content.

The average user follows the activity of these user profiles, but is not
directly able to determine the motivation of an author due to the unknown or
anonymous indication of the source. Multiple user profiles delegate content in a
way that leads to artificial structures that gradually hide the identity and
affect of the author.

A typical feature of these redistribution strategies is the hyperactivity of
engagement. The following distribution strategies illustrate this type of
behavior.

1. Semi-autonomous distribution - executed by humans interacting with similar
   content. This activity is repeated at an unusually high frequency for a human
   being.

2. Fully autonomous distribution - performed by a software-based technology that
   creates an activity on the identical or similar content by automating the
   user interaction. The ability of a machine to perform simple tasks in a
   repetitive manner surpasses the ability of humans for a long time.

These parameters are used in the project to measure the reputation of an
identity. Conversely, a negative reputation reduces the distribution radius in
order to counteract the controlled and targeted distribution of critical
content.

### Direct Re-Distribution

The actor who carries out a journalistic work takes up the misinformation and
tries to correct it in the best case. The result is distributed via everyday
media formats such as television, radio or newspapers to the user who is not
actively participating in digital media formats such as social media.

Unfortunately there are several variants of editorial orientation or tendency
(bias), including sensational journalism. Sensational journalism aims to reach
the widest possible readership by means of the aspects described below.

Sensational journalism is a kind of editorial prejudice that works specifically
with assumptions, overstatements and half-truths. The subjects of sensational
journalism can originate from virtually any area.

Sensational journalism does not fulfil the task of objective information
transfer, but specifically serves prejudices. The genre often operates on the
verge of slander and does not stop at defaming individuals, groups or
organisations. For this reason, sensational journalism is perceived by many
journalists as dubious and irreverent and is rejected.

> The human consciousness reacts to content that distinguishes itself from the
> background noise of the media. The aim of sensational journalism is to awake
> the reader's greed for sensation.

In the context of the controlled and targeted distribution or scattering of
critical content, this type of journalism enables a further distribution path.
Often popular and trendy content from social media platforms is picked up to
influence the perception of people who essentially ignore this type of digital
technology. A seamless distribution chain for critical content is created, which
covers all areas of people's lives, by combining the online with the offline
world.

This kind of journalism and daily reporting that is continuously repeated in
different media promotes the uncertainty of the individual.
