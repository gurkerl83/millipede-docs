# Attack vectors

## Technology and side effects

In IT security, a number of technical procedures have been established that allow the neutralization of malicious software-based applications or components such as viruses, spyware, malware and ransomware.

Although there is a superficial similarity between this and the problem formulated in the present paper, it must be noted that a different objective is pursued by an action taken by the attacker or actor.

In order to understand the relevance of this problem, it must be recognized that the operation of today's IT systems and infrastructures is not possible without the use of essential IT security components. The following table compares the similarity of the problems with regard to the objective, effect, cause and the tools used pursued by the attacker / actor. The reader interprets the table from bottom to top.
