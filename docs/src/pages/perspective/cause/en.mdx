# Incorrect identification of the cause

Too often, experts argue, the problem of targeted dissemination or distribution
of critical content can only be solved by addressing the operator of a digital
platform. The relevant content is ultimately deposited on the platform's digital
infrastructure, and only the operator can delete the data physically.

The method we developed shows that sovereignty over the operator's
infrastructure is not a prerequisite for using an existing digital platform to
digital platform to exchange content in a trusted manner - see chapter 12.3 -

/ Privacy Enhancing Technology (PET).

It is essential to understand that the problem definition in its overall effect
is by the model of interaction pursued by the operator for the fact that a
controlled interaction model followed by the operator that held and targeted
distribution and dissemination of the content of any kind can take place at all.

For some time now, there has been a demand to ensure privacy protection also in
digital environments. Despite this, no effective procedure has been established
to protect the individual's position against the self-interest of the operator
of a digital platform.
