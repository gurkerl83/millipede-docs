## Situation / requirement

The figure differentiates among three areas of action, each of which has its own
approach to address the problem. At first, the focus of the general and specific
approach is examined.

### Perspective - political education, journalism or psychology

<Tag text={'General Problem Solving'} />

#### Area - Political education

Actors who follow this approach usually focus on determining the nature of the
problem in general.

A scientific approach evaluates environmental factors, which

- have an effect on the individual, or
- move society as a whole system.

The focus of a consideration is usually directed at the properties or
characteristics of a particular technology or technological progress as a whole.

The assessment of consequences is accompanied by a recommendation for action.

> **Summary** - Comparing the results of recent scientific research, it can be
> observed that the findings not only show a very wide range of conclusions, but
> also sometimes make completely opposite recommendations to increase the scope
> for action - see Chapter 10.2 - Consideration of the sustainability and
> effectiveness of applied procedures by operators and the legislator.

#### Area - Journalism

##### Challenge - data compilation

A major challenge relates to the method of data compilation, which justifies a
conclusion.

In the area of political education or journalism, usually there is no competence
for data compilation that aggregates and evaluates a large number of data sets
from digital environments.

Instead, the attempt is to prove an assumption by carrying out experiments in
practical trials.

The procedure is identical in most experiments.

1. Targeted dissemination of false information in a social media application
2. Evaluation of the interaction network generated

> **Summary** - The problem is quantified using an unrepresentative data set.

#### Area - Psychology

In the domain of psychology, conclusions are explained by examining the network
of interaction made possible in social media applications. The foundation of the
argumentation is driven by the findings of established research on human
behaviour in order to explain the effect of the problem.

> **Comment** - In addition to the scientific approach, it is necessary to
> question the underlying conditions that result in or accompany the execution
> of a research project. A major noticeable aspect is the time at which the
> results of a given research project are made public. The time of publication
> often approaches the dates of significant events, at which a political
> structure of power is about to vote.

- The results are the focus of public discussion. Due to public media interest,
  governmental instruments are forced to take action to confront a problem.
- Due to wrong identified causes, premature recommendations for actions are
  made, which point in the opposite direction with regard to their effect.
