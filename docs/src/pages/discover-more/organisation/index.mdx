# Company / Organization

## General information

We are a small technology-oriented company (start-up) based in Regensburg /
Bavaria / Germany. Markus Gritsch founded the company on 16 May 2014 and
financed exclusively through private funds of the founder.

The motivation that drives the founder is the implementation of a free and open
technology that serves society that is able to reverse fundamental issues caused
by digital technologies.

1. Increase the resistance against technologies that cause (long-term) damage to
   the individual.
2. To transfer, preserve and promote the democratic set of values and order that
   defines our society into the digital world.

To deal with this kind of problem, considerable competencies in research and
development are required. In order to be able to bring these competencies to the
company despite a very limited financial scope, relevant approaches and results
of academic research are used to complement independently conducted research.

The software engineering we carry out distinguishes between freely and
commercially available technologies, which are provided in the form of a
service-oriented product.

## Alignment and philosophy

Our focus resides in the development of technologies whose effects are assigned
to the areas of Internet and communication (ICT) and digital security. The core
competence comprises the development of software-based applications with a
secure and decentralized architecture as well as a fully distributed and dynamic
runtime behavior.

In the description of the founder's motivation it is mentioned that the use of
digital technologies leads to considerable consequences for the individual in
the long term. It should be noted that it is not the technology as such, but the
purpose of the use that determines whether consequences are caused for the
individual.

## General objectives

> Project Millipede increases the sovereignty of the individual in the use of
> digital services. This is achieved by reversing or neutralizing the effect of
> a digital technology in the sphere of action.

In the case of use for the protection of privacy, this is achieved by preventing
the effect of the analytical methods used by the operator on the users' data.

In the case of application to invalidate the effect of critical content on human
consciousness, the scope of action of the individual is increased by immediately
recognizing whether the consumed content is authentic or corresponds to the
truth.

## Joint effort to achieve the general objective.

> Untrusted digital environments are enhanced with a comprehensive assistance
> system that allows the user to use secure and familiar workflows in any
> digital execution environment without requiring technical support from the
> vendor to support this technique.
