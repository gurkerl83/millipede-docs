# Reverse Engineering

> Reverse engineering is the process of taking a program apart to find out how
> it works. You can do this by examining the compiled app (static analysis),
> observing the app during runtime (dynamic analysis), or a combination of both.

## Overview

<ReversePrincipal />

- A program's elementary building block is a function. To gain insights about
  the scope and the internal workings of a function it has to be wrapped within
  an instrumentation function.
- Ones the intermediate function is in place it hides the original function from
  the outside. The intermediate function invokes the original function with its
  functional parameters. The return value of the original function is in the
  scope of the intermediate function, an observation of the functionality of the
  method is possible.
- Depending on the use case different subsequent steps can be specified. In
  order to protect an application against certain attack vectors, it is
  necessary to determine the application behavior against different attack
  vectors.
- An attack procedure exploiting a vulnerability is directed against the
  application. The reaction and defensive behavior of an application are
  observable through the second step. Conclusions of an observed problem are
  delegated to the engineering team, which initiates an adaptation of the
  application logic to prevent the exploitation of the identified security
  problem.
