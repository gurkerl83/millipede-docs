<Statement type={'problem'}>

The focus is on applications used in everyday life; billions of people are
accompanied by modern collaboration tools such as social networks and messenger
services, both in their private lives and at work.

Private data and the targeted commercial exploitation of derivable information
have been considered the favorite business model of many companies for quite
some time.

The top priority of such players is the long-term binding of as many people as
possible to their platform; if you take a closer look at the applications rolled
out to users, they are exclusively closed platforms.
